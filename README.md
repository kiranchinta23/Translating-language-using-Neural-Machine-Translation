# Translating-language-using-Neural-Machine-Translation

Machine Translation has been a highly active area of research since the early 1990s. After the modern resurrection of neural networks, machine translation has accomplished state-of-the-art performance. In this project, a neural machine translation model is built, using sequence-to-sequence model to build this deep learning model to translate one language to another automatically.
